# clc_final
advanced calculator program that was made in C++ 
This program was made to demonstrate my understanding of the C++ language in a way that is still useful.
To run this program simply double click the clc_final.exe file 
to view the code open the clc_final.c file in a code editor of your choice (I personally used VSC)
